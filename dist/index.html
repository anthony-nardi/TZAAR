      <h4>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h4>
      <p>
        The game is won if:
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>Your opponent runs out of one of the 3 types of pieces.</p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p>The opponent can't capture during the first phase of their turn.</p>
      </p>

      <h4>GAMEPLAY</h4>
      <p>With the exception of the very first move of the game, each turn will consist of two phases.</p>
      <p>Phase 1: Capture</p>
      <p>The current player must take one of their pieces and capture a piece of the other player. Pieces move along the lines
        that make up the board. The capturing piece must be stacked equal to or higher than the piece to be captured.</p>
      <p>Phase 2: Stack or Capture</p>
      <p>During phase two, the current player has the option of either capturing another piece using the same rules as above
        or stacking one of their pieces. To stack a piece, move the piece you wish to put on top of another one of the pieces
        you own. The face of the moved piece will replace the face of the piece stacked on. The height of the stacks are
        added together.</p>
      <p>Note: Be careful stacking. You don't want to replace any pieces that would lose you the game!</p>

      <h4>NOTES</h4>
      <p>The first move of the game is a capture phase. After the move is made, the next players turn begins in phase 1.</p>
      <p>Pieces eligible for capture or stacking must be connected by a straight line to the moving piece.</p>
